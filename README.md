# Description:
This project was done for GDG Kutaisi Hackathon 2025 in 36 hours. The theme was Educational Technology. Our idea was to create a platform where you can learn Physics by seeing simulations that you can change; but other than that you can also create your profile with an avatar, see history of Physics as a timeline, see news on the front page, register to courses and take quizes to test you knowledge and connect with other Physics lovers by posting on the Community page (the communities should be divided into subjects but this is a demo version therefore it doesn't actually work).
